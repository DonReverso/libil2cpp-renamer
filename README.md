\
This is a code-parsing IDAPython script that allows you to represent function names to libil2cpp.so from dumped Assembly-CSharp.dll with a little help of dnSpy.

# Requirements
- IDA 7.4+
- IDAPython with Python 3.X
- dumped `Assembly-CSharp.dll` (usually with [il2cppdumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper))
- [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy)

# Why do I need this?

You're probalby wondering: "why do I need this plugin, when I already have an auto-generated by il2cppdumper `ida_with_struct_py3.py` IDAPython script?" If you have any troubles with either creating or loading this script, you're left with no other options rather than just looking at the name in dnSpy, copying the RVA, jumping to it in IDA, then renaming a function. This is VERY time-consuming.

# How to use

1. Dump `Assembly-CSharp.dll` from `libil2cpp.so` (with [Il2cppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper))
2. Open `Assembly-CSharp.dll` in dnSpy.
3. `File -> Export to Project`. Choose any Version you like; the most important things are **generated .cs files of classes**.
4. Open `libil2cpp.so` in IDA, wait for it to be analyzed, then load this script.
5. It will ask __full__ path to the folder with exported CS classes, provide it.
6. It will then parse all function names and rename automatically IDA functions respectfully, and will create them where IDA was supposed, but didn't for some reason.

# Future improvements

It's hard for me to even imagine a situation where this script will be more useful than auto-generated `ida_with_struct_py3.py` from Il2cppDumper. But if there's some troubles with generating or launching it, this script can be handy. And if people will be interested in it, here are some possible improvements on my mind that can be implemented:
- Parsing function's arguments' names
- Parsing arguments' types
- Parsing return types
- Parsing non-standard types and structures

If this repo does give any effort compared to auto-generated script, and it actually helped you, let me know - I'll work on those improvements. If you have any issue, trouble or improvement idea, feel free to write your thoughts on donstego@gmail.com.

Good luck in reversing =]
